<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Carrot ribbon salad is a light, refreshing dish that brings out the natural sweetness and crunch of fresh carrots.
To make it, large carrots are peeled into thin, wide ribbons using a vegetable peeler, creating a beautiful and elegant base.
These ribbons are often tossed with a simple vinaigrette made of olive oil, lemon juice or vinegar, honey or maple syrup, 
and a touch of salt and pepper.
For added flavor and texture, ingredients like fresh herbs (such as parsley or mint), sliced almonds, or crumbled feta cheese 
can be mixed in.

This salad is perfect as a side dish for warm-weather meals or as a colorful addition to a holiday spread. 
It's quick to prepare and looks impressive with its vibrant colors and delicate curls.
The bright, tangy dressing pairs beautifully with the natural earthiness of the carrots, while the optional toppings add 
layers of texture and taste.
Here's how to make this recipe.
