<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Green bean casserole is a beloved comfort food and a staple at many holiday gatherings, especially Thanksgiving.
The dish typically starts with canned or blanched fresh green beans, which are mixed with cream of mushroom soup 
to create a rich and creamy base. 
A splash of milk helps to smooth the texture, and seasonings like black pepper, garlic powder, or a bit of soy sauce 
can be added to enhance the flavor. 
The mixture is poured into a baking dish and topped with crispy fried onions, giving the casserole its signature crunch.
It's then baked until bubbly and golden on top.
