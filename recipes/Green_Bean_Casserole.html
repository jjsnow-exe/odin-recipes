<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Green bean casserole is a beloved comfort food and a staple at many holiday gatherings, especially Thanksgiving.
The dish typically starts with canned or blanched fresh green beans, which are mixed with cream of mushroom soup 
to create a rich and creamy base. 
A splash of milk helps to smooth the texture, and seasonings like black pepper, garlic powder, or a bit of soy sauce 
can be added to enhance the flavor. 
The mixture is poured into a baking dish and topped with crispy fried onions, giving the casserole its signature crunch.
It's then baked until bubbly and golden on top.

This hearty casserole is both simple to prepare and packed with flavor, making it a crowd-pleaser at any table.
The contrast between the creamy filling and crispy topping adds a satisfying texture to each bite, while the green beans 
provide a fresh, slightly earthy balance. Whether youâ€™re making it from scratch or using shortcuts for a quicker prep, green bean casserole is a timeless side dish 
that never goes out of style. Here's how to make this recipe.
