<h3>Description</h3>


<p>
Potato kugel is a traditional Jewish comfort food that’s crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.
It’s made by grating potatoes and onions, then combining them with eggs, matzo meal or flour, and simple seasonings like salt and pepper.
Some recipes also include a bit of baking powder for lightness, or garlic for added flavor.
The mixture is spread into a greased baking dish and baked until golden brown, forming a crunchy top layer that contrasts 
with the soft interior.   
</p>

<p>
Potato kugel is often served as a side dish during Shabbat dinners or Jewish holidays like Passover
It pairs perfectly with roasted meats, brisket, or even on its own with a dollop of sour cream. 
Loved for its satisfying texture and rich, savory flavor, kugel is a nostalgic dish that’s simple yet deeply comforting
Here's how to make this recipe.
