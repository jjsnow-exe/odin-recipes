<h3>Description</h3>

<p>
Fried okra is a classic Southern side dish known for its crispy texture and savory flavor
The recipe typically starts with fresh okra pods, which are sliced into bite-sized pieces.
These are then coated in a seasoned cornmeal mixture—often with added flour, salt, pepper, 
and sometimes paprika or cayenne for a little heat.To ensure a good coating, the okra is usually dipped in buttermilk or beaten egg before dredging it in the dry mix.
Once the pieces are fully coated, they’re deep-fried or pan-fried in hot oil until golden brown 
and crispy on the outside, while remaining tender on the inside.

The result is a flavorful and crunchy snack or side dish that pairs well with everything from fried chicken to barbecue
Fried okra is beloved for its satisfying texture and ability to bring out the vegetable’s unique, slightly grassy flavor 
without being slimy, which can be a concern with other cooking methods.
Served hot and often with a sprinkle of salt or a dipping sauce like ranch, this dish is a staple at many Southern tables 
and a great way to introduce newcomers to the charm of okra.
Here's how to make this recipe.
